Persons consulted:  I worked briefly with Irene Lee on the assignment, she helped me scour the pages of the assignment page to find what actually needed to be submitted.
Other sources:  MATLAB online documentation for plotting help

Time estimate:  10 hours
Thoughts:  this is actually a fascinating assignment, not because of the data structures or search algorithms (although the board-first search algorithm is interesting) but because it suggests one, simple question that we do not answer - what is the very best Boggle board?  I intend to try to answer this after I submit the rest of the assignment.
